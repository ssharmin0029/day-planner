## Description 
In this assignment we were asked to build a WorK Day Scheduler that keeps track of daily working hours. As an employee it is essential for anyone to be able to maintain important events in a daily planner, so the individual in question can manage his or her time efficiently and effectively. It's a very simple application, yet extremely powerful. When the user opens the application, he or she will be presented with the current day, date and time on top of the header other than the title. There are 9 time-blocks with each block designated to hold an hour (static), an event in the text-area (entered by the user) and has a corresponding button to save the event in the localStorage. 

Also, each time-block is color coded, depending on the current hour of the day. If the hour has already passed, the text-area of each time-block will appear in Beau Blue (past), whereas the current hour will appear in Silver Pink (present). On the other hand hour(s) that is or are yet to come will appear in Ash Gray (future). Apart from that the header has a button called Clear Schedule, which resets the text-areas as empty and clears up the localStorage with a single click. Otherwise each event will persist in the day planner until the user clears up his or her browsing data. 

There was a lot to learn and use on top of what we already know in order to build this application. It gave me some good practice to get somewhat comfortable with Bootstrap, jQuery and Moment.js Library. I was able to spend more time on traversing the DOM, one of the crucial aspects of building a web application. Also, I am grateful to the instructor of this course, who helped layout a structure for this project, which was a great start. Not sure for how many people in the class, but it was definitely a big help for me.
